            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <section >
                <p>Look up at the sky, at a tree, what animal are you most likely to see? A bird. What is a bird? Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by feathers, beaks, and the ability to fly in most species. They lay eggs, have lightweight
                    skeletons, and possess various adaptations for different ecological niches, from the songbirds in forests to the penguins of the polar regions. Their diverse forms and behaviors make them a vital part of ecosystems worldwide. Since
                    evolution is a proven theory, we know that birds must have evolved or devolved from previous creatures, so therefore like most creatures on earth, they must have descended from dinosaurs. Research and fossil records indicate that birds
                    are indeed descendants of dinosaurs. This evolutionary transition involved a series of adaptations, such as the development of feathers, the reduction of their size, and the evolution of characteristics that allowed them to take to
                    the skies, ultimately leading to the diverse avian species we see today.

                    <h3>Dinosauria & Ornithischia</h3>
                    <p>Birds have significantly evolved from dinosaurs, which can be first classified in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur" target="_blank">Dinosauria</a> clade. This clade is divided into two orders, Saurischia, and Ornithiscia,
                        which are now considered unranked clades. According to Norman et al. (2022), regarding the relation of birds to dinosaurs, it is part of the Ornithischian clade, meaning bird-hipped as compared to Saurischia meaning reptile-hipped
                        (p. 1283). Birds have similar bone structure to Saurischia creatures. Many dinosaurs fall underneath this clade as well. In addition, Bates et al. (2012) highlighted that birds and the foundations of Ornithischians have a similarity
                        regarding their pelvic bone structures through the study of osteology (p. 214).

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurischia" target="_blank">Saurischians</a> are also split into two Theropdas and Sauropodomorpha (Including the sauropods and their ancestral relatives). Theropdas are identified by hollow
                        bones and three toes and claws on each limb. While Sauropodomorpha are identified by their very large size, long necks, and tails. Which we know a famous dinosaur comes from, a Brachiosaurus.

                    <h3>Theropoda & Coelurosauria</h3>
                    <p>Therapods are a part of the Saurischian Clade, therapods are split into two groups avian and non-avian, avian being that it has bird-like features and non-avian as no bird-like features. So using proper terminology, birds are avian
                        theropod dinosaurs; other dinosaurs are non-avian theropod dinosaurs, and (strange as it may sound) birds are technically considered reptiles. In an article, Rauhut, and Foth (2020) emphasized that many scientists, such as Thomas
                        Henry Huxley first hypothesized that birds are from small theropod dinosaurs (p. 2). Moreover, Huxley’s hypothesis of theropods regarding the early stages of birds introduced new phylogenetic methods, which caused a significant
                        surge in the success of obtaining avian characteristics (Rauhut & Foth, 2020, p. 3). Huxley saw that they had incredible similarities (especially the Coelurosaurs) (DinoBuzz), but this later fell through as birds are theropod dinosaurs.
                        Dr. Jacques Gauthier as well as other scientists based this classical analysis on the structural anatomy of these creatures. The first birds shared this skeletal connection with many coelurosaurian dinosaurs which were in their
                        own clade like the Maniraptora (DinoBuzz).

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelurosauria" target="_blank">Coelurosaurian</a> dinosaurs meaning hollow-tailed Lizard, are thought to be the closest relatives of birds, in fact, birds are considered to be coelurosaurs.
                        This classification may be where birds got their feathers from. According to Philip J. Currie, he considered that it was likely and probable that all coelurosaurs were feathered, but several skin impressions of this group's members
                        had pebbly, scaly skin, indicating that feathers did not entirely replace scales in all species. But birds were the result of the total replacement of scales. This clade is also where birds had their digestive system changed, they
                        gained the ability to eat and digest plant matter, leading to an omnivorous diet, which then evolved into the many different ways to consume matter/food. These are Insectivorous, Herbivorous, and Carnivorous.

                    <h3>Maniraptora & Paraves</h3>
                    <p>Birds are considered to be in the lineage of bipedal dinosaurs that was first established in the mid-Jurassic maniraptoran theropods, which contained extensive arms, and hands, as well as feathered bodies during the Mesozoic maniraptoran
                        radiation (Nebreda et al., 2021, p. 566). Furthermore, Nebreda et al. (2021) argued that throughout their research in articles, they evaluated the evolutions across the transitions of dinosaurs to birds that showcased their transformation
                        of maniraptoran limbs, and their adaptations of flight as a new way of transportation (p. 567). Paravians are bipedal, two-legged creatures, that walk with hind legs. In an article, Nebreda et al. (2021) argued that birds are categorized
                        to be part of Paraves, which is a clade group of mid to small-sized maniraptorans that includes troodontids, and emblematic fossils, such as Archaeopteryx (p. 566). The Paraves clade group is a classification that groups a widespread
                        group of theropod dinosaurs, which include the extinct Troodontid, an extremely similar relative to the Aves class.

                    <h3>Avialae & Aves</h3>
                    <p>Avialans are referred to as all birds that include fossils from the past, and Avians are only referred to as modern birds, which is also defined as a crown group (Novas et al. 2020, p. 347). Certain traits of the Avialan birds were
                        not transferred to Avians as those traits slowly died out or got replaced by other traits as time went by. Aves is a bird taxonomic classification. The class belongs to the phylum Chordata (chordates). Oviparous reproduction, complete
                        double circulation, wings (modified front limbs), feathers, and beaks without teeth (save for some Mesozoic fossil birds with conical teeth in both jaws) are among the traits they share. There are around 10,000 Aves species worldwide,
                        which occupy practically all settings. Aves and birds may build nests, engage in courtship, and territorial conduct, and provide parental care. They range in size from a few centimeters (Bee Hummingbird) to several meters (Ostrich)
                        (Biology Articles). There are two main subclasses of the Avian class, the Archaeornithes and the Neornithes. Members of the Archaeornithes subclass are all now extinct, they are mostly extinct early Jurassic-era bird fossils. The
                        other subclass, Neornithes are the birds that are considered modern birds, the birds that are extant today (Biology Articles).

                    <h3>Ornithothoraces & Euornithes</h3>
                    <p>Ornithothoraces is a derived avian clade group that displays many specimens of the foundations of birds, such as the Jeholornis from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota in the northeast of China (Zheng et al. 2020, p. 1). In addition,
                        the Jeholornis was found in the data that it is related to other Mesozoic birds (Zheng et al. 2020, p. 6). Onithuromorpha and Enantiornithes form the Ornithothoraces that is identified by advanced skeletal and soft tissue features,
                        such as small airfoil of feathers of the hands that help support the way they can control the speed of their flight, such as landing (O’Connor, 2020, p. 1167). Euronithes can be classified as part of the foundations of extant birds
                        and a subclade of ornithotoracine subclade, such as the new genus Archaeohynchus (Foth et al, 2021, p. 8). Moreover, Liubov Ben-Nun (2022) highlighted that Euornithes means “true birds” since they are part of the ancestry of modern
                        birds (p. 11). The Archaeopteryx was the first fossil that showcased traditional reptilian characteristics, such as teeth, and clawed fingers, including wings with flight feathers that displayed similarities to modern birds (Ben-Nun,
                        2022, p. 8).

                    <h3>Neornithes</h3>
                    <p>Neornithes often referred to and known as Modern Birds, are as mentioned before a subclass of Aves, by their characterization of many adaptations to flight, their four chamber hearts, feathers, and their differentiation from older
                        birds (Biology Articles). Now this subclass is divided into two suborders the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeognathae" target="_blank">Palaeognathae</a>, flightless birds, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neognathae"
                            target="_blank">Neognathae</a> Neognathae, birds that can take flight. Of these two suborders Palaeognathae is split into two, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinamou" target="_blank">Tinamidae</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratite"
                            target="_blank">Ratite</a>. Tinamidae has only one species the Tinamou, which is one of the most ancient living groups of birds. The ratties are just a group of medium to large birds, we know a number of birds that fall underneath
                        this umbrella such as Emus, Ostriches, Cassowaries, and much more.

            <section>
                <p>In total with the information we can say for a fact that birds are related to dinosaurs but not only that they are in an odd way in fact dinosaurs, modern dinosaurs. The list below shows the total connections that birds have to dinosaurs,
                    where Maniraptora is the main split point towards the general evolution of birds as we know it today.
