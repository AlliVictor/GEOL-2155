                <h1> Introduction: What Seperates Silisaurdae From Dinosauria?
                </h1>
                <section>
                    <p>Silesauridae, a group of ancient archosaurs, holds a pivotal place in the evolutionary history of reptiles. Placing themselves as the sister group of 
                        Ornithischia and, more intriguingly, of Dinosauria, they provide important insights into the early history of these important reptilian lineages. 
                        In addition to differentiating them from their better-known contemporaries, such as crocodilians and dinosaurs, their unique dental evolution provides 
                        insights into the complex processes of tooth replacement and attachment. Examining the details of their dental development helps us better comprehend the 
                        broader phylogenetic links within the archosaur lineage, as well as their distinct evolutionary trajectory. Thus, examining the subtleties of Silesauridae's 
                        dental adaptations offers an engrossing investigation of their place in the evolutionary narrative, encompassing the intriguing procedure of tooth replacement.

                        <h3>Evolutionary Differences Between the Sister Group</h3>
                        <p>While the teeth of dinosaurs and crocodylians are permanently attached to their sockets in a process known as permanent gomphosis, the teeth of silesaurids,
                           the ancestors of these animals, are permanently attached in a different way (LeBlanc et al., 2017). Based on studies conducted on a variety of silesaurid 
                           specimens, it was discovered that these early dinosauriforms suffer from delayed ankylosis, in which the teeth take a long time to fuse to the jawbone 
                           because they are kept suspended in their sockets by a periodontal ligament.
                        </p>
                            <p>This implies that, in contrast to the more established circumstances in dinosaurs and crocodylians, the tooth attachment mechanism of silesaurids 
                            represents a unique evolutionary trend. Heterochrony refers to the possibility that the oral attachment mechanism of dinosaurs and crocodylians evolved 
                            independently. Alternatively, a return to a previous, more rudimentary state could be symbolized by the silesaurid condition (Mestriner et al., 2021).
                            </p>
                            <p>This study emphasizes the importance of dental ontogeny in comprehending the evolutionary path of early archosaurs by comparing the tooth attachment
                                 of silesaurids and dinosaurs. Selesterids exhibit delayed ankylosis, which implies a particular feature of their dental development and could be a 
                                 sign of different ecological adaptations and evolutionary pressures. Gaining knowledge of these subtle differences in tooth attachment processes 
                                 among archosaurs advances our comprehension of the larger evolutionary patterns and adaptations that exist within this varied group of extinct 
                                 reptiles (Mestriner et al., 2021).
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition, the condition of permanent gomphosis may have evolved independently in the two main dinosaur lineages, Ornithischia and Saurischia, 
                                if Silesauridae is in fact a branch of Ornithischia. These results highlight how crucial it is to carefully take into account the length and timing 
                                of various dental development phases when examining the evolution of early archosaurs (Mestriner et al., 2021).

                        <h3>Evolutionary Similarities Between the Ornithischians</h3>
                        <p> Ornothischia, any member of the large taxonomic group of herbivorous dinosaurs comprising Triceratops and all dinosaurs more closely related to it than 
                            to birds. The ornithischians (meaning “bird-hipped”) are one of the two major groups of dinosaurs, the other being the saurischians (Britannica et al., 2019). 
                            The phylogenetic tree represents the gradual development of dental traits related to both omnivorous and herbivorous diets in silesaurids, connecting them 
                            to the ornithischian clade. “Silesaurids have been considered the sister group to Dinosauria ... However, an alternative hypothesis considered silesaurids 
                            as ornithischian dinosaurs. Subsequently, more comprehensive studies have reinforced this hypothesis. In this scenario, silesaurids are recovered within 
                            Ornithischia as the sister group to typical ornithischians.” (Müller et al., 2020) This demonstrates the dietary similarities between Silesaurids and 
                            Ornithischians due to their omnivorous/herbivorous diets. Which connected their feeding styles and tooth formation causing the belief that silesaurids 
                            stem from the core ornithischians. Therefore, this demonstrates other dental anatomical-related dissimilarities between silesaurids and their sister group,
                            the Dinosauria. While filling in the whole of ornithischian evolution by relating them to the Silesauridae.

                        <h3>The Study of Tooth Replacement</h3>
                        <p>The similarities between crocodilian and dinosaur teeth lines were found to be morphologically equivalent. This led to the belief that von Ebner 
                            glands (minor salivary glands at the back of the tongue, where they secrete the digestive enzyme amylase, which helps people break food down while 
                            chewing (Gerald M et al., 2018)) form on dinosaur teeth as well. Incremental growth lines observed in extinct non-avian dinosaurs were similar to 
                            lines of von Ebner observed in extant mammals and reptiles and likely reflected a homologous growth pattern among amniotes 
                            (Erikson, 1996a, 1996b; D’Emic et al., 2019) (Maho et al., 2020, p.2). Amniotes are a clade of tetrapod vertebrates comprising reptiles, birds, and 
                            mammals. The early amniotes diverged into two main lines soon after the first amniotes arose (Carter, n.d.). The initial split was into synapsids and 
                            sauropsids. Tooth replacement rates can be estimated by identifying the presence of von Ebner lines, which offer a continuous growth record of a tooth. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The study of tooth replacement rate is by definition, the difference between the total number of days recorded in a functional tooth (i.e., the tooth’s 
                            age from the start of the mineralization of its dentine) and the total number of days in the successive replacement tooth for a tooth position18, or the 
                            age of the functional tooth (Commun et al., 2022).  Tooth replacement has been determined to be clade-specific in the study of dinosauriaformes, with 
                            rates as fast as 35 days as seen in herbivores, and as slow as 777 days as seen in carnivores (Erikson, 1996a, 1996b; D’Emic et al., 2019) 
                            (Maho et al., 2020, p.2).

                        <h3>Silisauridae Tooth Replacement Cycle</h3>
                        <p>The study of silesaurids reveals a unique dental growth trajectory that differs significantly from the trends seen in crocodilians and dinosaurs. 
                            Importantly, the early eruption phase reveals a dramatic difference in the way growing teeth are positioned. The teeth are positioned closer to the 
                            gum line, following the developmental pattern observed in the majority of amniotes, including dinosaurs, rather than submerged in the jaw as is usually 
                            the case with crocodilians. In addition, the gomphosis stage in silesaurids has a temporary but unique tooth suspension mechanism, which is very 
                            different from the hard and permanent tooth attachment seen in mammals, crocodiles, and dinosaurs. The discovery of delayed ankylosis in 
                            silesaurids—described as the progressive joining of teeth to the jawbone—points to a striking similarity between the dental development trajectory of 
                            dinosaurs and crocodilians (Snyder, LeBlanc, Jun, Bevitt, & Reisz, 2020) (Mestriner et al., 2021). These fascinating similarities highlight possible evolutionary links and 
                            provide important insights into the complex interactions between dental morphology and the larger phylogenetic relationships among extinct archosaurs. 
                            They also highlight how important it is to fully comprehend the subtle developmental stages in order to piece together the evolutionary history of these 
                            mysterious reptilian groups. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The dental analysis of silesaurids shows unique patterns in their developmental processes that are not found in crocodilians or dinosaurs. 
                          The initial tooth eruption places silesaurid teeth closer to the gum line, in line with the trend seen in most amniotes and dinosaurs, unlike the submerged 
                          position within the jaw typical of crocodilians. Moreover, silesaurid gomphosis exhibits a distinct tooth suspension mechanism, distinct from the permanent
                           attachment seen in mammals, crocodiles, and dinosaurs. The slow fusion of teeth to the jawbone, or delayed ankylosis, has been identified in silesaurids. 
                           This dental development is similar to that seen in crocodilians and dinosaurs. These fascinating results illuminate possible evolutionary linkages and 
                           offer important new understandings of the intricate interactions between tooth morphology and the larger phylogenetic relationships among extinct 
                           archosaurs (Mestriner et al., 2021).
